## Git cloning

One good way to think about your Github account is that it is your personal file cabinet up in the sky. Github offers you this space in the "Cloud" entirely for free. However, anyone can come by and make a copy of your files from that cabinet. This is exactly what the `git clone` command does. It takes a copy of a set of files, stored in someone's Github account, and then pastes them directly into your local computer. Github calls that file set a public repository, or repo for short. For a fee, Github allows you to put a lock on some of the files in your account. These are called private repos, and Nitro is a great example of this.

Yesterday we created are first public repo on Github. Today, you will be using a previous pair's repo to do your work. This means that both of you will need to use `git clone` to make a copy of another Github user's file cabinet. This can be done with `git clone <copied_ssh_url>`, where the "copied_ssh_url" can be acquired from the Github GUI.
